  "synopsis":"The ground shakes with rumbles from an explosion down the street. You hear disembodied shouts from your teammates. Bullets whiz by your helmet and explode on the wall behind you, sending chunks of concrete and rubble flying through the air. You're focused on your mission, but time seems to stop for a moment as you feel your weapon in your hand. Another bullet bursts against the wall, this time closer â€” and louder. That got your attention. There's no time for zoning out in the red zone. Meet back up with your team and make it off the <b>Battlefield</b> alive.<br><br>Featuring the powerful Frostbite 2 engine, <b>Battlefield 3</b> utilizes every ounce of power to provide the most immersive shooter experience you've ever known. Get ready to hold your ground on the front lines of a global conflict, and keep your finger on the trigger as the missions take you from city streets in New York and Paris to the relentless desert sands of Tehran.
